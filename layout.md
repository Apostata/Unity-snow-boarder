# Layout

## Description

We must create the level layout for the game. This will be the first step to start the game development.

1. Create a closed sprite shape to represent the hills that the snowboarder will slide on./
to add multiple sprites to the shape we will create a `Closed Sprite Shape` and add the sprites of snow to it at the edges, and the blue fill at the center.

2. Add an edge collider to the sprite shape to make the snowboarder collide with the hills.
